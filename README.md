# Carbon-Flux
One of the biggest problems this world is facing now is the emission of carbon dioxide. Since 1958 humans have added 200 gigatons of Carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. In order to measure the CO2 fluxes (in and out of the gas) many organizations has setup flux tower all over United States which measure the amount of CO2 exchanged between atmosphere and ecosystem. My dataset contains 4 year (2015-2018) records of measurement from these flux towers. The data was gathered from Ameriflux (https://ameriflux.lbl.gov/). My work is to clean this data and plot the visualization of it and then compare it with the visualization of similar data which is gathered from satellites.
